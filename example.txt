Now the hungry lion roars And the wolf behowls the moon, Whilst the heavy ploughman snores, Now the wasted brands do glow, Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud, Puts the wretch that lies in woe In remembrance of a shroud.

Over hill, over dale, Through bush, through briar, Over park, over pale, Through blood, through fire, I do wander everywhere, Swifter than the moone’s sphere; And I serve the fairy queen, To dew her orbs upon the green.
I must go seek some dewdrops here, And hang a pearl in every cowslip’s ear.
Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I’ll be gone: Our queen and all her elves come here anon.
